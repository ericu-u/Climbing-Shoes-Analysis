    "# Climbing Shoes Analysis Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to determine the most cost-efficient climbing shoes for an intermediate climber. My motivation for this project comes from both my love for climbing and my need for new climbing shoes. Shoes are such an important and powerful aspect of climbing, that they often make or break climbing attempts. I often joke that anytime I fail a climb, it's a problem with the shoes.\n",
    "\n",
    "My projection for this project involves web-scraping information from the men's climbing shoes section from the REI (Recreational Equipment Inc.) website. Information I want to get include the shoe name, shoe brand, price, discount status, and ratings. Once I get this information, I want to utilize an SQL database to store the data and potentially create a prediction model that scores the shoes. Lastly, I want to summarize my findings in clean visualizations through Tableau and/or Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started! First things first, let's import some python packages import for web-scraping as well as SQL connecting."

    "I originally only wanted to use the requests and Beautiful Soup packages to webscrape the REI site, but the products' ratings were dynamic html content, which Beautiful Soup can't access. Thus, I delved into the splinter package specifically for the ratings. This wasn't really what I wanted because I'm unfamiliar with this process and also I needed to download chromedriver.exe which opens a new browser while running the program. In addition, having this additional software means that I need to eventually update these extra parts when Chrome or chromedriver updates rollout."

From this, we can identify that La Sportiva either sells many more products than their competitors which increases the number of customer reviews, or La Sportiva sells the same amount as other brands but their customers are more inclined to leave reviews on their products. This is solid evidence that La Sportiva is the most popular brand."

    "With this horizontal bar graph, we can see that Metolius and Butora have relatively higher average ratings than the other brands. However in the dataframe above it, we see that they have 5 and 2.8 average number of ratings total in comparison to other brands like La Sportiva that boast 29.46 average ratings per shoe. With small sample sizes (low rating counts), it's always hard to determine the validity of the ratings because the rating is determined by such few individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, I think we can say that Butora, Metolius, and even TENAYA shoes are a little riskier to buy with potentially great shoes, but for products with more reliable ratings, La Sportiva, evolv, and Scarpa are your go to.\n",

While it's not a statistically significant difference, we can justify this finding because business models tend to discount products that aren't being sold much. Lower rated products don't sell as well as highly rated products, so it makes sense for brands to discount lower rated products. However, another strategy involves discounting hot products to boost its sales even more. With both these strategies and the lack of statistically significant evidence, we fail to conclude a difference in rating based on discounts.\n",
