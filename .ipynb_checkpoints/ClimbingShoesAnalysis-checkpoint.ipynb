    "# Climbing Shoes Analysis Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to determine the most cost-efficient climbing shoes for an intermediate climber. My motivation for this project comes from both my love for climbing and my need for new climbing shoes. Shoes are such an important and powerful aspect of climbing, that they often make or break climbing attempts. I often joke that anytime I fail a climb, it's a problem with the shoes.\n",
    "\n",
    "My projection for this project involves web-scraping information from the men's climbing shoes section from the REI (Recreational Equipment Inc.) website. Information I want to get include the shoe name, shoe brand, price, discount status, and ratings. Once I get this information, I want to utilize an SQL database to store the data and potentially create a prediction model that scores the shoes. Lastly, I want to summarize my findings in clean visualizations through Tableau and/or Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started! First things first, let's import some python packages import for web-scraping as well as SQL connecting."

    "\n",
    "I originally only wanted to use the requests and Beautiful Soup packages to webscrape the REI site, but the products' ratings were dynamic html content, which Beautiful Soup can't access. Thus, I delved into the splinter package specifically for the ratings. This wasn't really what I wanted because I'm unfamiliar with this process and also I needed to download chromedriver.exe which opens a new browser while running the program. In addition, having this additional software means that I need to eventually update these extra parts when Chrome or chromedriver updates rollout."
